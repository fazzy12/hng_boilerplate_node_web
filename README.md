## Installation

To get started with this boilerplate, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**

```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/boilerplate-repo.git
   cd boilerplate-repo

```

2. **Install dependencies****

```
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_API_KEY=your_email_api_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=your_flutterwave_secret_key
LEMONSQUEEZY_SECRET_KEY=your_lemonsqueezy_secret_key
```

## Configuration

1. **Database Setup**

Make sure your database is set up and configured properly. Update the DATABASE_URL in your `.env` file with your database connection string.

2. **Run Migrations**

Apply the database migrations to set up the necessary tables:

```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

```

## Usage

1. **Start the Development Server**

```
npm run start:dev

```

This command will start the development server on http://localhost:3000 and watch for any changes in your code.

2. **Run the Production Server**

```
npm run start

```
This command will start the production server.

3. **Access the API Documentation**

Visit the Swagger UI documentation to explore the available endpoints:

[Swagger UI Documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/KALUIFEANYI00/hng-boilerplate_api_for_node_express/1.0.0)

4. **View the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

To understand the database design and relationships, refer to the ERD:

## Scripts
Here are some useful npm scripts that you can use during development and production:

- `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- `npm run start:dev`: Starts the development server with live reloading.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
- `npm run test`: Runs the test suite (if available).
- `npm run lint`: Runs the linter to check for code style issues.

## API Documentation

The API documentation provides detailed information about each endpoint, including request parameters, responses, and examples. You can access the Swagger UI documentation at the following link:
